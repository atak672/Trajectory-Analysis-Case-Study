    HELLO!!
    So the way I designed this algo is that you initialize a line segment using xy points. And minDistanceFromPoint is used by the Segment class
    to calculate the minimum distance from itself to a point q.
    
    So if a line starts at point a, x1 is the
    x coordinate of a and y1 is the y coordinate of a.
    
    And if the line ends at b, x2 is the x coordinate of b
    and y2 is the y coordinate of b.
    
    Now that we have a class which signifies a segment, minDistanceFromSeg calcualtes the minimum distance between the line segment
    and a point q (with coordiantes qx and qy on the xy plane). It then returns the minimum distance.
